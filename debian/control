Description: A formalisation of the core ELF and DWARF file formats written in Lem  
 Linksem is a formalisation of substantial parts of ELF linking and DWARF debug information .
 .
 The ELF formalisation (and parts of the ABI formalisation) are currently also
 being used as a subcomponent of the rmem architectural exploration tool, for 
 parsing ELF files and setting up initial machine states.
