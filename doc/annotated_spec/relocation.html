</p><h1>Relocation</h1><p>
<font color="red">See Lem file elf_relocation.lem for all relevant definitions.</font>
Relocation is the process of connecting symbolic references
with symbolic definitions.
For example, when a program calls a function, the associated call
instruction must transfer control to the proper destination address
at execution.
Relocatable files must have
``relocation entries'' which
are necessary because they contain information that
describes how to modify their section contents, thus allowing
executable and shared object files to hold
the right information for a process's program image.

<dl compact="">
<p></p><dt><code>r_offset</code></dt><dd>
This member gives the location at which to apply the
relocation action.
For a relocatable file,
the value is the byte offset from the beginning of the section
to the storage unit affected by the relocation.
For an executable file or a shared object,
the value is the virtual address
of the storage unit affected by the relocation.
<p></p></dd><dt><code>r_info</code></dt><dd>
This member gives both the symbol table index with respect to which
the relocation must be made, and the type of relocation to apply.
For example, a call instruction's relocation entry
would hold the symbol table index of the function being called.
If the index is <code>STN_UNDEF</code>,
the undefined symbol index,
the relocation uses 0 as the ``symbol value''.
Relocation types are processor-specific;
descriptions of their behavior appear in the processor
supplement.
When the text below refers to a relocation entry's
relocation type or symbol table index, it means the result of applying
<code>ELF32_R_TYPE</code> (or <code>ELF64_R_TYPE</code>) or <code>ELF32_R_SYM</code> (or <code>ELF64_R_SYM</code>),
respectively, to the entry's <code>r_info</code> member.
<hr>
<pre>	#define ELF32_R_SYM(i)	((i)&gt;&gt;8)
	#define ELF32_R_TYPE(i)   ((unsigned char)(i))
	#define ELF32_R_INFO(s,t) (((s)&lt;&lt;8)+(unsigned char)(t))

	#define ELF64_R_SYM(i)    ((i)&gt;&gt;32)
	#define ELF64_R_TYPE(i)   ((i)&amp;0xffffffffL)
	#define ELF64_R_INFO(s,t) (((s)&lt;&lt;32)+((t)&amp;0xffffffffL))
</pre>
<font color="red">See functions elfXX_relocation_r_sym and elfXX_relocation_r_type for XX=32,64 in elf_relocation.lem for implementations of the above macros.
ELFXX_R_INFO is not needed as access to the relocation entry's info field can be used instead.</font>
<hr>
<p></p></dd><dt><code>r_addend</code></dt><dd>
This member specifies a constant addend used to
compute the value to be stored into the relocatable field.
</dd></dl>
<p>
As specified previously, only
<code>Elf32_Rela</code> and <code>Elf64_Rela</code>
entries contain an explicit addend.
Entries of type <code>Elf32_Rel</code> and <code>Elf64_Rel</code>
store an implicit addend in the location to be modified.
Depending on the processor architecture, one form or the other
might be necessary or more convenient.
Consequently, an implementation for a particular machine
may use one form exclusively or either form depending on context.
</p><p>
A relocation section references two other sections:
a symbol table and a section to modify.
The section header's <code>sh_info</code> and <code>sh_link</code>
members, described in 
<a href="http://www.sco.com/developers/gabi/latest/ch4.sheader.html">``Sections''</a>
above, specify these relationships.
Relocation entries for different object files have
slightly different interpretations for the
<code>r_offset</code> member.
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<p></p><li>
In relocatable files, <code>r_offset</code>
holds a section offset.
The relocation section itself describes how to
modify another section in the file; relocation offsets
designate a storage unit within the second section.
<p></p></li><li>
In executable and shared object files,
<code>r_offset</code> holds a virtual address.
To make these files' relocation entries more useful
for the dynamic linker, the section offset (file interpretation)
gives way to a virtual address (memory interpretation).
</li></ul>
Although the interpretation of <code>r_offset</code>
changes for different object files to
allow efficient access by the relevant programs,
the relocation types' meanings stay the same.
<p>
<a name="relocation_composition"></a>
The typical application of an ELF relocation is to determine the
referenced symbol value, extract the addend (either from the
field to be relocated or from the addend field contained in
the relocation record, as appropriate for the type of relocation
record), apply the expression implied by the relocation type
to the symbol and addend, extract the desired part of the expression
result, and place it in the field to be relocated.
</p><p>
If multiple <i>consecutive</i> relocation records are applied
to the same relocation location (<code>r_offset</code>), 
they are <i>composed</i> instead
of being applied independently, as described above. 
By <i>consecutive</i>, we mean that the relocation records are 
contiguous within a single relocation section.  By <i>composed</i>,
we mean that the standard application described above is modified
as follows:
</p><ul>
<li>
In all but the last relocation operation of a composed sequence,
the result of the relocation expression is retained, rather
than having part extracted and placed in the relocated field.
The result is retained at full pointer precision of the
applicable ABI processor supplement.
<p></p></li><li>
In all but the first relocation operation of a composed sequence,
the addend used is the retained result of the previous relocation
operation, rather than that implied by the relocation type.
</li></ul>
<p>
Note that a consequence of the above rules is that the location specified
by a relocation type is relevant for the
first element of a composed sequence (and then only for relocation
records that do not contain an explicit addend field) and for the
last element, where the location determines where the relocated value
will be placed.  For all other relocation operands in a composed
sequence, the location specified is ignored.
</p><p>
An ABI processor supplement may specify individual relocation types
that always stop a composition sequence, or always start a new one.
